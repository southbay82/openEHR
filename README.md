# AI Generated EHR — Proof of Concept

Welcome to the AI Generated EHR (Electronic Health Record) project! This repository is an open, collaborative exercise in "vibe coding"—rapidly prototyping and evolving a next-generation EHR system using modern coding practices, AI assistance, and a strong focus on developer and user experience.

## Project Purpose

This project is a proof of concept to:
- Explore and document the core workflows of an EHR system (physician, clinician, billing, admin, front desk, etc.)
- Experiment with AI-driven design, documentation, and code generation
- Practice clean, modular, and secure coding standards
- Foster a creative, iterative, and collaborative development vibe
- Serve as a learning resource and inspiration for future EHR solutions

## Key Features
- Modular documentation for every major user workflow
- Explicit user roles and security rights
- Strong coding and documentation standards (see `.rules/`)
- Context checkpoint and decision log for project traceability
- Open to experimentation, refactoring, and "vibe-driven" improvements

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Explore the `/doc` folder for high-level design and workflow breakdowns
3. Review `.rules/` for coding and collaboration standards
4. Contribute ideas, designs, or code — all with a spirit of experimentation and learning

## Philosophy
This is not a production EHR. It's a creative sandbox where ideas, code, and documentation flow together. The goal: to see how far we can push EHR design and development when we let the vibes (and the AI) lead the way.
