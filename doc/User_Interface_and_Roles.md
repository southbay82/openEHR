## UI Design Considerations
- Role-based navigation and dashboards
- Contextual actions and quick access for common tasks
- Responsive and accessible design for all user types
- Security and privacy controls based on role
- Fine-grained permission system to restrict access to patient data, billing data, and configuration as appropriate
- Audit trails for sensitive actions (data access, edits, configuration changes)

---

## Example UI Layout
- Sidebar or top navigation with role-specific modules
- Dashboard widgets for quick overview (tasks, messages, alerts)
- Search and global patient lookup
- Notification center for reminders and alerts

---

## Customization Notes
- Allow practices to tailor UI modules and workflows per role
- Support for multi-role users (e.g., clinician with billing access)
- Configurable security rights and permission templates
